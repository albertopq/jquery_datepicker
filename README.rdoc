= jQuery Datepicker Rails plugin

This simple gem allows you to add a date picker field into your views.

== Getting Started

Pre Rails 3.1:

1. Add into your Gemfile:

    gem 'jquery-rails'

2. Execute this command to install the needed js files:

    rails generate jquery:install --ui


3. Insert into your Gemfile:

    gem 'jquery_datepicker'

Don't forget to install the CSS!

Rails 3.1:

1. Insert into your Gemfile:

    gem 'jquery_datepicker'

2. If you are using Rails 3.1 with the asset pipeline enabled (default), the necessary files are already in your asset pipeline. Just add `//= require jquery` and `//= require jquery_ujs` to your app/assets/javascripts/application.js


== Usage

Add this to your view.

    <%= datepicker_input "user","birthday" %>
	

Where "user" is your model name and "birthday" the name of the datefield.

You can also use it with the form helper like:

    <% form_for(@user) do |f| %>
      <%= f.datepicker 'birthday' %>
      <%= f.submit 'Create' %>
    <% end %>

Nested attributes are permitted as well:

    <% form_for(@user) do |f| %>
      <% f.fields_for(@nested) do |f2| %>
        <%= f2.datepicker 'birthday' %>
      <% end %>
      <%= f.submit 'Create' %>
    <% end %>

You can pass options as it would be a normal text_field, plus all the datepicker options available (http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/#options)

    <%= datepicker_input(:foo, :att1, :minDate => -20, :maxDate => "+1M +10D", :tabindex => 70) %>
